Modern horror roleplaying in Nutscript.

A cool skeleton schema made by Howl on the bones of Adaster's old Atomic schema for the purposes of playing horror-ish or otherwise dark scenarios in pretty much any setting post-Victorian. I've used it for private tabletop RPG style campaigns since 2020. You could feasibly refit it into anything, but it's intended for story-focused content that has dark themes and maybe horrible shit going down.

To use this, download the repo as a zip then dump the "modern" folder in your gmod gamemodes folder. Make sure you get the latest version of Nutscript first! It will not run on any version below 1.1-Beta and was built for 1.2 (with parts being 1.1-B era don't sue me)

I've had it work for stuff set in 1899 as well as stuff set in the far future of the 2500s, and even done stuff in a collapsing abstract world somewhere between 1999 and 2010. It'll work for basically anything if you want to put the work in to fill out the lore.

Credits for the coding involved goes to, in no particular order, me (Howl), Dickmosi, Adaster, Chancer, Black Tea, TovarischPootis, Lechu, Pilot, DoopieWop, and anyone else I've missed. If I forgot you in this list or your code is used without direct attribution PLEASE forgive me and let me know so I can immediately credit you -- I've tried to keep stuff credited where possible but this schema is two years old and a lot of stuff has been cut and pasted without any expectation of it seeing the light of day outside of what I do.

Neat stuff in here you might not find anywhere else:
- Limb severing system (has no true gameplay effect but is cool for roleplay)
- Pseudo-radio/internet etc text channels that don't require an item and can be added on the fly
- Cinematic text intro system (admin-fired, but still neat)
- Version and content agnostic versions of the Respite spooky commands like flashlight flickering and hallucinations.
- A drugs base with visual effects
- Tarot card deck
- Typing indicator is visible at ANY distance and is a big fuckoff sign saying "TYPING" so nobody gets S2k'd for no reason anymore. Woohoo!
- A modification of Chancer's hidden faction from Respite so you can have admins hide on the scoreboard as GMPCs!
-- ^ You need to use /plywhitelist hidden to access said faction. It is a different faction. Admins do not hide by default.
- A basic plugin that makes admin commands silent.
- Cigarettes with a cigarette card system like Red Dead Redemption 2.
- FUCKING UNO! FUCKING UNO! FUCKING UNO! HELL YEAH! UNO! FUCKING UNO!
- Lots of dumb easter eggs that I never dummied out, and some I added for you to find as you code. :)

Along with this there is a huge spectrum of quality of life stuff for admins and generally useful paraphenalia in here for running smaller-scale RP. I highly advise you don't use this script with a huge 24/7 80 player server because I have only ever tested it in 6 hour sessions with 10 clients. Safety not guaranteed.

Feel free to contact me in the NS Discord ( Spectrum#6450 ) or via Github message (does this place have them?).
Please be aware replies will be slow on Github and I reserve the right to refuse to talk to anyone if I feel like it.
I don't use Steam anymore, Valve ruined Steam chat so I'm way too lazy to log into it anymore.

I will provide:
- general support if shit gets broken and it's not by a GMod update
- general support if you just need to know what does what.
- general advice for running private stuff (not GM advice, just the technical details)

I will not provide:
- a full non-example schema or lore writing for you (that is your job and i consider it the easiest part)
- the schemas I mentioned above (they're a mess. yes, this is the cleaned up stuff.)
- the content for the schemas I mentioned above (personal reasons.)
- any details about the communities or servers I run with this (personal reasons. i play with my friends and friends alone. if you want to meet people, go to a bar chief.)
